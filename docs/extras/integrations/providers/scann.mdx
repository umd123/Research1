# ScaNN

>[Google ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann)
> (Scalable Nearest Neighbors) is a python package.
> 
>`ScaNN` is a method for efficient vector similarity search at scale.

>ScaNN includes search space pruning and quantization for Maximum Inner
> Product Search and also supports other distance functions such as
> Euclidean distance. The implementation is optimized for x86 processors
> with AVX2 support. See its [Google Research github](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann)
> for more details.

## Installation and Setup

We need to install `scann` python package.

```bash
pip install scann
```

## Vector Store

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/scann).

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import ScaNN
```
