# Dingo

This page covers how to use the Dingo ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Dingo wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python SDK with `pip install dingodb`

## VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around Dingo indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Dingo
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Dingo wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/dingo.html)
